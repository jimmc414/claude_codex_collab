# Codex Workflow Overview

This directory contains the Codex-specific configuration for the structured development pipeline. It mirrors the Claude Code track with prompts, configuration files, and documentation tailored for the Codex tooling.

## Directory Structure

```
codex/
├── pipeline/           # Codex pipeline configuration
│   ├── prompts/        # Prompt templates
│   └── config/         # Configuration files
├── commands/           # Codex commands
└── docs/               # Codex documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

Documentation for the Codex workflow is in progress. Review the contents of the `pipeline/` and `commands/` directories for the current state of the configuration.

## Usage

Implementation guidance will be added alongside the evolving pipeline assets. Follow the examples provided in the Claude Code track until Codex-specific instructions are available.

## GitHub Actions Integration

Codex workflows reside in `.github/workflows/codex/`. Extend or customize them as the Codex tooling matures.
